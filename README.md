## Verificational Model

### 1. Preprocessing
  
   * #### 1.1. Objective, assumptions, database and steps of preprocessing
   
     * 1.1.1. The objective of author's repository was to introduce a method of image preprocessing for verification of offline handwritten documents authorship by artificial neural network (through classification of preprocessed image pairs to positive `same author` or negative `different authors` class).
       
     * 1.1.2. Author's assumptions were that:
     
        - Document images ought to be processed simultaneously by two separate convolutional neural networks and classified by one multilayer perceptron (fully connected layers);       
        - Preprocessing shouldn't affect image quality to preserve most of handwriting features.
            
     * 1.1.3. Database:
       
        - Subsets of 1415 training and 189 test documents (full page scans) from CVL database (F. Kleber, S. Fiel, M. Diem, R. Sablatnig, *CVL-Database: An Off-line Database for Writer Retrieval, Writer Identification and Word Spotting*, "In Proc. of the 12th Int. Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) 2013" 2013, p. 560 - 564). 
            
     * 1.1.4. Steps of preprocessing:
               
        - `Step_1_Preprocessing.py` - conversion of images (scans of whole documents) to grayscale (scale from black = 0 to white = 255), color inversion, extraction of writing space from images, reduction of extracts dimensions to [1024x1024] pixels, division of extracts into [256x256] pixel patches, conversion from the `tif` to `png` format. Patches which do not contain or contain a small amount of text are skipped by the program because of the arbitrary average pixel value threshold - in any case, patches can be sorted by their size and manually removed on that basis;
            
        - `Step_2_Dataframe.py` - creation of a dataframe (a `csv` file which can be edited in any spreadsheet program, *e.g.* calc / excel) separately for the test and training subset, by combinatorial paring of image names into the positive class, and a random combinatorial paring of image names into the negative class (the number of possible negative combinations is much greater than the number positive ones, so all positive instances are created first and then the negative instances are randomly combinated until their number is equal to the number of positive instances). Image name pairs and their labels are ordered by rows, according to columns `left convolutional path`, `right convolutional path`, and `label` (labels are determined by the convergence or divergence of identifiers - *i.e.* first four digits of the image name which denote its author). Above method requires that test and training images are kept in different directories. However, it is not necessary to create a `csv` file, *i.e.* it will be created by the program (and if such a file was already created manually, please indicate its directory and name in the program code);
        
        - Third step - it is crucial to randomize rows in dataframes because `tf.keras.Model.fit_generator` shuffles only the order of the batches (between epochs), hovever method of randomization by rows depends on a given spreadsheet program (most commonly an additional column of random numbers is generated by a `=Rand()` function and used as a Sort Key for Data Sorting in selected columns);   
        
        - Fourth step - to create a validation dataframe (utilized only for testing of the model during its training, mostly after each epoch) simply create a `csv` file in any given spreadsheet program, then copy about 10-20% of already randomized instances from the test dataframe (it is most probable that the number of positive and negative instances will by equivalent);
        
        - Fifth step - add headers to dataframes columns, *e.g.* `left convolutional path, right convolutional path, labels` for names labels of image pairs.  
        
   * #### 1.2. Preprocessing programs:
   		
     * 1.2.1. Programming language - Python 3.7.3.
  
     * 1.2.2. Libraries - OpenCV 4.1.0, Numpy 1.16.4, tqdm 4.33.0, and other common python libraries.
  
     * 1.2.3. To utilize above preprocessing programs:
  
        - Install Python and listed libraries (installation method depends on user's operating system);
        - Download the repository;
        - Using any given text editor, access programs code and edit image/dataframe save directories paths (save the program files in `py` format); 
        - Place a given preprocessing program file in a directory of images to be preprocessed by that given program (that's the simplest method);
        - Access the directory - which contains a given preprocessing program file and images to be preprocessed - through the terminal / command-line interpreter (method  of access depends on user's operating system);
        - In the terminal type the command `python3 program_name.py` to run the named program;
        - If it were necessary: to force quit (terminate) a running program use a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + C` in an opened terminal window, or `Ctrl + Z` to suspend the running program, to resume the paused run type the command `fg` (works in terminals of most operating systems, *e.g.* macOS, Linux).
             
  
### 2. Verificational Model

   * #### 2.1. Model
   
     * 2.1.1. Model architecture:
      
        - Siamese CNN - dual path convolutional network, where both paths (left and right path) are two separate ConvNets (either AlexNets or VGG13s), which outputs are flattend, concatenated and then passed to the fully connected layers for binary classification. Inputs to both conv-paths are identical in shape, dataset and preprocessing.
      
        - AlexNet Core Network - {as desc in paper}
        
        - VGG13 Core Network - {as desc in pap except for 2nd pool}. Hovever the output size of the first convolutional block (1st and 2nd conv layer followed by 1st max pooling layer) is reduced by pooling of size [3x3] and stride [3x3] - as opposed to vanilla 1st max pooling layer where pool size is [2x2] and stride is [2x2]. Therefore (flattend and concatenated outputs of VGG core nets) input to FCL is of size [none, 25000] as opposed to [none, 65000].
        
        - Fully Connected Layers - three FC layers [4096, 1024, 256] and one output neuron (sigmoid activation) for AlexNet core network;
        
        - Activation - ReLU for all layers, sigmoid for the output neuron;
        
        - Batch Normalization (BN) Layers - applied after ReLU activations of convolutional layers;
        
        - Dropout Layers - applied after dense FCL layers;
               
     * 2.1.2. Language, libraries and framework / API:
        
        - Python3;
        - Numpy (data sequence), Pandas (dataframe), Matplotlib (metrics plot), Pydot and GraphViz (model plot);
        - TensorFlow's implementation of the Keras API (model).
   
     * 2.1.3. Implementation:
       
        - Google Colaboratory - Python 3 Jupyter Notebook, GPU type runtime - 2019;
        
        - Time - 500ms/step for Alexnet, 000ms/step for VGG.
